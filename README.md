# SuperDuperBomberman
This project was developped together for the Ecole polytechnique de Bruxelles' Object Oriented Programming course (INFO-H200) with Gaetano RIPOLLINO and Robin CHARLIER. The aim of the project was to mimic the gameplay of the Bomberman game series by Hudson Soft (now part of Konami Corp.) while showcasing some of the main characteristics of Object Oriented Programming.
